    "PyAF uses a machine learning approach to forecasting. A lot of time series models are generated and their forecasting quality is compared on a validation dataset (most recent part of the whole signal). \n",
    "To summarize, PyAF is performing a competition between a large set of possible models/hypothesis and selecting the best to perform the final forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "the models used/tested in PyAF are signal decompositions generated on the fly internally. An additive signal decomposition is the sum of a **trend** (long term) , **periodic** and an **irregular** component as described in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_of_time_series\n",
    "\n",
    "PyAF generates tens of possible decomposition for the input signal and outputs the best. One can control the amount/types of decompositions, enable/disable such of such component,  and review the performance of each decomposition internally.\n",
